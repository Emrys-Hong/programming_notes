## machine learning experience

```
morvan python:                    project based; entry level

stanford computer vision:         systematic learning; theory

Andrew Ng machine learning:       systematic; machine learning math

stanford_deep_learning notes:     to be commented
(https://stats385.github.io/)

fastai:                           state-of-art; intuition; code heavy; project based (recommend have some background first)

google machine learning:          to be commented

Andrew Ng deep learning:          to be commented

youtube channel:                  application based; project-based; get more resources
(sentdex, siraj, ect)                  

ml blogs:                         state-of-art; not really implemented; intuition
(medium; hackernoons)

github:                           code-based;

SUTD machine learning notes:      math; theory; intuition; basic; a lot of times not so useful in real life

learning communities:             state of art; ask question; tricks; resources; chances
(https://nurture.ai/)

personal bloggers:                systematic; theory; but follow classic
(e.g. nlp related: http://ruder.io/)
