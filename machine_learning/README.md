## machine learning experience

```
morvan python:                    project based; entry level

stanford computer vision:         systematic learning; theory

Andrew Ng machine learning:       systematic; machine learning math

University notes:                 to be commented
[stanford_deep_learning](https://stats385.github.io/)

fastai:                           state-of-art; intuition; code heavy; project based (recommend have some background first)

youtube channel:                  application based; project-based; get more resources
(sentdex, siraj, ect)                  

ml blogs:                         state-of-art; not really implemented; intuition
(medium; hackernoons)

github:                           code-based; tensorflow, keras, pytorch, auto-sklearn state of art model

SUTD machine learning notes:      math; theory; intuition; basic; a lot of times not so useful in real life

learning communities:             state of art; ask question; tricks; syllabus systematic resources; chances to know new people; environment

personal bloggers:                systematic; theory; but follow classic
(e.g. nlp related: http://ruder.io/)

quora, zhihu                      insights; non academic;

wikipedia                         systematic; quick; problem based; resourceful (ner)
