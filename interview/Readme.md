## Skills
1. **tell the interviewer about each step you are going to make**, if you are not sure which is better you can also discuss with him. and then go to code. In this way, you will be safely getting the right direction and then proceed to coding. otherwise, you may not get the code out, or you may not get the optimum code, and the interviewer wont stop you as he does not know what you are doing.
e.g. Here are two ways to solve this problem. the first way is ..., the second way is, shall i go with this way?
2. think in concept first. and do it on a paper.
e.g. try to explain the psuedo code the the interviewer.
3. think about different ways first. and then confirm you assumption.
e.g. Will there be any positive numbers
