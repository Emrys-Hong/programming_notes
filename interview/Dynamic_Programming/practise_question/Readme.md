# Dynamic programming category

## Binary-decision-making:
These problem is either yes or no for each subproblem, all of them made up the big problem.
- [Array combination](Array_combination.md) all the possible combinations of a array.
- [Change count](Change_count.md)
- [Decoding message](Decoding_message.md)
- [knapsack problem](Knapsack_problem.md) (It is almost the same as [Staircase problem](Staircase_problem.md))

### subproblem - find path problem
They have if statements as recursion.

- [3SAT_problem](3SAT_problem.md)
- [find-path](findpath.md)


## maximum-decision-making:
making decisions among subsubproblem to form subproblem
difficulty: We need to figure out how they make decision based on a certain criteria, whether it is finding the minimum or finding the maximum of the subproblems.
- [cutting rod]
- [pyramid shortest path](pyramid_shortest_path.md)
- [Longest common sequence](longest_common_sequence.md)
- [matrix chain multiplication](matrix_chain_multiplication.md)
## progression-problem:
The third sequence is dependent on the previous n sequence.
The difficulty is to findout how they progress.
- [Staircase problem](Staircase_problem.md)


## Others
- [Hanoi Tower](Haoni_tower_problem.md)

TODO: add cutting rod problem, viterbi algo, binary search tree, space problem. and look through the algorithm.
