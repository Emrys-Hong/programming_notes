## Array
1. Given an array A, what is the most ocurring element in this array. The algorithm should run in O(n), Hint: using a structure that searches fast. -- hashmap
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/Array/Mostly-frequent-Occuring)
2. check if an array is an rotation of the other, the algorithm should run in O(n), Hint: using pointers
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/Array/Check-rotation) 
3. Given two sorted array, output their common elements, runs in O(n) time. Hint: use pointers
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/Array/Common-Elements)
## String
1. Given a string, output all the characters that occur only once - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/String/Nonrepeating-character)
2. Check One way string; Give two String, whether it can change one operation (insertion, deletion, replace) to get to the other one. Hint: devide it in two conditions.
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/String/One-way-String)
## 2D array
1. Mine Sweeper: fill in the numbers surrond the mines that indicate the mine, give the position of the mine and the grid size. Hint: use for loop conditionally
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/2DArray/MineSweeper)

2. Mine Sweeper 2: after clicking clicking some place have no mine, show the area that should be shown to the gamer. Hint: use a BFS 
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/2DArray/MineSweeper2)

3. Rotate a 2D array: rotate a 2D array 90 clockwise. Hint: find the relation between the position before rotating and after rotating 
   - [ans inplace](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/2DArray/Rotation2DArray/inplace)
   - [ans outplace](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/2DArray/Rotation2DArray/out-of-place)

## LinkedList
1. find the nth element from the start, or from the end, if it surpass the null, it should return null. 
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/LinkedList/Nth-element)
## Tree
1. Check binary search tree: check if a tree is a binary search tree, if yes return true, vice versa. Hint: use limit and recursion 
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/Tree/Check-binary-search-tree)

2. lowest common ancester: find the lowest common ancester for two element. Hint: finding the two element would take O(n) time, therefore the total time taken should be O(n). and we would need O(logn) auxilary space to store those. 
   - [ans](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/programming_notes/tree/master/interview/11-interview-questions/Tree/Lowest-common-ancester)
