## Elements of dynamic programing
1. Optimal substructure

The solution to a problem can be obtained by solutions to sub-problems with no circular dependency. The result of subproblem A is not dependent on the subproblem of B.

2. Overlapping subproblems

A recursive solution contains a "small" number of distinct sub-problems (repeated many times), so it can solve each subproblem just once.
