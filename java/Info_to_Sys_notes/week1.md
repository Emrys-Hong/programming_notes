# ISTD Info to Sys week1

## static method
instance method can access both static variable and instance variable.

static method can only access both static variable.

static method cannot be overriden.

## pointers( variables)
to the primitive type can be "changed"

to the reference type cannot be overriden.

## passing variable functions
the previous variable will be overriden by the new arg in the functions.

we can use ```this.variable``` to reference the variable in the class.

(args passed in the function is called a heap.)

## constructor overriden
if the arg constructor is provided. then the no arg constructor will not be provided.

so it is good to have the no arg constructor.
