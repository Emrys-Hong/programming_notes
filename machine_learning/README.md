## machine learning journey

morvan python:                    project based; entry level

stanford computer vision:         systematic learning; theory

Andrew Ng machine learning:       systematic; machine learning math

fastai:                           state-of-art; intuition; code heavy; project based (recommend have some background first)

google machine learning:          to be commented

Andrew Ng deep learning:          to be commented

youtube channel:                  application based; project-based
(sentdex, siraj, ect)
